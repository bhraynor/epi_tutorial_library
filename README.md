================

## Project description

This repo contains a series of tutorials for quantitative epidemiologic
methods in R. The primary focus will be on characterizing and modeling
infectious disease.

## Table of Contents

The repo is organized into folders by methodology:

**01\_Spatial/**  
*A folder of sample codes to explore spatial data - both visualization
and analysis.*

01\_ChoroplethMaps

-   The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the
    rendered html output.

-   R code for a tutorial on spatial visualization and analysis
    primarily focused on choropleth maps.

-   Includes code to work with point,line, and polygon spatial data
    using the sf package.

-   This tutorial runs through an example using freely accessible data
    on the city of Philadelphia looking at litter index and trashcan
    availability.

**02\_TransmissionModels/**  
*A folder of sample codes for mathematical models of infectious disease
transmission.*

## How to use

To use these codes, clone the repo and run the codes.
