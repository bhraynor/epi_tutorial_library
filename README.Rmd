## Project description  
This repo contains a series of tutorials for quantitative epidemiologic methods in R. The primary focus will be on characterizing and modeling infectious disease.

## Table of Contents  
The repo is organized into folders by methodology:  

**Spatial/**  
*A folder of sample codes to explore spatial data - both visualization and analysis.*   

01_ChoroplethMaps 

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for a tutorial on spatial visualization and analysis primarily focused on choropleth maps.  

+ Includes code to work with point,line, and polygon spatial data using the sf package.  

+ This tutorial runs through an example using freely accessible data on the city of Philadelphia looking at litter index and trashcan availability.  



**TransmissionModels/**  
*A folder of sample codes for mathematical models of infectious disease transmission.* 

## How to use  
To use these codes, clone the repo and run the codes.
